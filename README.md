# Northwestern Student Holdings Site
This is a website we built for Northwestern Student Holdings! We're continuously updating the site to support the needs of the organization. We use Node.js and Express for the server and a ton of interesting, handwritten code for the visual/design features. We like to experiment with plugins as well. 

Check out the site here! http://northwesternstudentholdings.com/

###Setting Up The Project
First, clone this project to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/nshtech/NSHSiteServer.git` from the Terminal, or by using the "Clone to Desktop" button.

This project uses Node.js. In order to run the site locally, you will first need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Mac users are suggested to install Node with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

Once Node is installed, you should be able to use Node Package Manager (npm). This project requires a few packages to run. To install the necessary packages, open a Terminal window and `cd` to the project directory. Then, run `npm install`. This command will automatically install all of the dependencies, since they are listed in packages.json.

After this, you should be ready to run the code. Remain in the top-level directory for the project and run `node server.js` from the terminal. A message should appear noting that the site is being served to http://localhost:3000/. Open this page, and you should see a local version of the site running.
