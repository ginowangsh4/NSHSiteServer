                                    <strong>Northwestern Student Holdings was founded in 2007 by a group of students who were searching for an organization that could offer them real-world entrepreneurial experience at Northwestern. </strong> 
                                    Unsatisfied with their options, they proposed a new organization – a holdings company that could oversee the inception and management of student-run businesses; the companies’ profits, in addition to being used for capital expansion and manager compensation, would be used to launch new ventures. Under the guidance of several trusted business leaders, professors and advisors who later became members of the original board of directors, the students launched Northwestern Student Holdings (NSH).

                                    <strong>Initially, NSH started with two companies: Chicago Unzipped and NU|Tutors. </strong> 
                                    Since then, the NSH portfolio has grown to include six businesses, and the group has instituted infrastructure to ensure continued expansion. Further, NSH continues to dedicate resources to the personal and professional development of its members.

                                    With revenues and profits growing at double-digit rates annually, and the establishment of NSH as Northwestern’s premiere student entrepreneurship organization, Northwestern Student Holdings is on a path to ever-higher levels of success.
